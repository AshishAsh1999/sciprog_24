Introduction

This repository, sciprog_24, contains my Git Assignment Project for ICHEC (2024-2025). It showcases my understanding of scientific programming concepts using C, with each assignment managed in a separate branch for clear version control and organization.

Project Structure

Main Branch: Contains the primary README.md and general documentation.
Practical Branches: Each assignment is on its own branch (practical(number)), including:

Source code files written in C.

A README.md with compilation, execution, and verification instructions.


Running Practicals

Each branch's README.md provides instructions to:

Compile using gcc.

Run the program.

Verify the output.
